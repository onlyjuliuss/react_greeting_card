# React + Vite
# Greeting Cards Application

Project Overview
Developed a React application called "Greeting Cards" utilizing Vite for project scaffolding and Tailwind CSS for styling. The project showcases reusable components like Header, GreetingCard, and App, highlighting a modular approach to UI design. Acquired hands-on experience in setting up projects with Vite, styling components using Tailwind CSS, and implementing dynamic content rendering through props.

The project includes three key functional components:
Header: Displays the primary heading, "Welcome to Greeting Cards."
GreetingCard: A reusable component that accepts title and message as props to render personalized greeting cards.
App: Serves as the main component, managing card data and rendering multiple GreetingCard components with unique content via props.

This project demonstrates concepts such as dynamic content rendering through props, clean UI design using Tailwind CSS, and efficient development workflows with Vite. Example outputs include cards like "Happy Birthday!", "Congratulations!", and "Thank You!", each styled dynamically.

Below is a screenshot showcasing the final output of the application, including the header and three greeting cards rendered as expected:
